## Hello

This is my first post!

I always want to have a blog that is open to public so that I may share my ideas to someone I don't know. I tried some online blog sites and also thought of building my own website on AWS or Google Cloud. Finally, I find github.io. It is quite flexible that you can use it to build a simple blog site or fancy pages. Then I decided to use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and find a template with somewhat old-style UI.

Jekyll's keywords are "Simple, Static, Blog-aware". It is not that powerful as WordPress but still you can have your cool page layout and interaction effects. I am not good at building a well-organized website, so I use a template developed by Haoyang Gao, who is a front-end engineer in Alibaba. It is a pretty good one that provides most I want.

There is no fashion UI here but that is enough for me since I want to focus on writing -- on content rather than form.

I am going to write things about what I am reading, what I am doing and what I am thinking. Basically, there will be some technology notes and some fun things and good articles on the Internet. Hope my posts can help you, my friend.

As Andrew Wilson said, writing is a good way to keep ourselves thinking and growing. So keep working and keep writing.
