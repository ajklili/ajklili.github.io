## Web

The basic concept of client/server computing, then, is not so complicated. The problems arise because you have a single server trying to serve many clients at once.
To minimize latency, programmers work hard to offload processing tasks, often to the client machine, but sometimes to other machines at the server site, using so-called middleware. (Middleware is also used to improve maintainability.)

The Web is actually one giant client/server system. Itâ€™s a bit worse than that, since you have all the servers and clients coexisting on a single network at once.

The remainder of the problem can be solved only by incorporating the ability to run programs on the client end, under the browser. This is called client-side programming.
